Follow along:
-------------
- Add a new array `nums` with 4 different numbers in it
- Add a single number variable `num`
- Add calls to `createCanvas` and `background`
- Create an `ellipse` using `num` for the radius arguments
- Create a second `ellipse` using `nums[2] ` for the radius arguments
- Create a new array `words` with 4 different words in it
- Use `textSize` and `text` to draw the word "rainbow" on the canvas
- Replace "rainbow" with `words[0]` in the call to `text()`
- Add a new variable `index` and use `words[index]` in the call to `text()`
- Add the `mousePressed` function and use it to increase `index` by 1
- Update `mousePressed` logic to reset `index` to 0 when it's value is 4
- Add another word at the end of `words`
- Update `mousePressed` logic to reset `index` to 0 when it's value is equal to `words.length`

Check your understanding:
-------------------------
- An array is a ___ of values.
- In programming, what is the first counting number?
- What can you put in an array?
- What happens if you try to access an invalid index/position in an array?
