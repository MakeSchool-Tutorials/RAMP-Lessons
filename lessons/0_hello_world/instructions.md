This first tutorial is designed to quickly get you familiar with the course structure and how to get the most out of it. Don't worry too much about understanding the code here, you'll get familiar with it soon enough once you jump into next tutorial.

Each tutorial starts out with some code provided, and then you will be challenged to make updates to integrate new programming concepts. The Code Challenges increase in difficulty as you progress.

Section 0 (because we always like to remind ourselves that counting in programming starts at 0 instead of 1) assignments ask you to watch some tutorial videos and then apply the newly learned concepts in small challenges.
Section 1 is a single assignment that guides you through creating a larger project. And Section 2 allows you to take your project to the next level with your own custom additions.

Getting started
Each assignment is set up like a web page, that can use HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In the code window, you should see several tabs along the top that you can switch between.
index.html
sketch.js
index.css

This course uses p5.js, which is a Javascript library (extra features packaged together for convenience), so the majority of your code will be added to sketch.js, with occasional edits in index.html. Challenges will always indicate which file the edits should go into.

Submitting
Once you are finished with an assignment you can submit it using the buttons in the upper right corner.

The instructor can mark the assignment as completed,  or send it back to you with a request for changes if it's not quite working yet.

There is no need to wait for feedback before moving on to the next assignment if you feel ready.

Getting Stuck
What if you are stuck and haven't completed the challenges? Add a question or indicate which part you are stuck on and submit the assignment.

An instructor will then review your submission, give feedback on your code and answer any questions.

Additionally, you can attend any online office hours session. (Calendar link above)

Office hours are on a drop-in basis, no need to schedule in advance, just join the meeting by clicking the link on the calendar event. If none of the office hours fit your schedule and you need help, please email me and we can make other arrangements.

Other Questions
Email ramp@makeschool.com for any other questions you have. Good luck, and happy coding! :)


Complete Code Challenges
in index.html
1- Add your name inside the h1 tags
add your name so that it says "YOURNAME's Hello World"

in sketch.js
2- Update the values and uncomment lines 19-23
Remove the // to enable a line of code
Change the answers inside of the quotation marks
Re-run the program and see your new answers on the screen

3- Fill out short-answer questions at the top of sketch.js
Some assignments will have questions that we want you to write out an answer to
Answer the questions at the top of the file using comments (put // in front of each line)


Bonus Challenge

Getting help and asking questions:

You can always email the instructor for more complex questions, but using comments in your code is a fast and easy way to get feedback. Any time an instructor sees a question in your submitted work we can better focus our feedback to help you.
Use a comment at the top of the file to ask the instructor a question about the code
Include a line number that references which part of code you are discussing

example:
// what does the createCanvas function do on line 16?
