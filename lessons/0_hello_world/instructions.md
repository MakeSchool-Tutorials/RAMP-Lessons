We are excited to have you in the program and we look forward to helping you strengthen your programming skills.

This first tutorial is designed to quickly get you familiar with the course structure and how to get the most out of it.

### Getting started
Each assignment is set up like a web page, that can use HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In the code window, you should see several tabs along the top that you can switch between:
```
index.html // web page
sketch.js  // JS file where you will complete challenges
helpers.js // JS file with helper code you should not change
```

This course uses p5.js, which is a Javascript library (extra features packaged together for convenience), so the majority of your code will be added to sketch.js.

In some assignments there will be code in helper.js that helps make the program more beginner friendly but that you don't need to interact with directly. Feel free to look at the contents, but do not make edits.

### Submitting
Once you are finished with an assignment you can submit it using the buttons in the upper right corner.

The instructor can mark the assignment as completed,  or send it back to you with feedback for changes if it's not quite working yet.

There is no need to wait for feedback before moving on to the next assignment if you feel ready.

### Getting Stuck
What if you are stuck and haven't completed the challenges? Include details about what you are stuck on in a comment at the top of sketch.js and submit the assignment.

An instructor will then review your submission, give feedback on your code and answer any questions.

### Office Hours
Office hours are on a drop-in basis, no need to schedule in advance, just join the meeting by clicking the link on the calendar event. Calendar link above.

If none of the office hours fit your schedule and you need help, please send an email and we can make other arrangements.
