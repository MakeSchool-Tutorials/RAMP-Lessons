1- Add your name
add your name, so that it says "YOURNAME's..."

in sketch.js
2- Make the monster move diagonally
Use monster.speed to update both monster.x and monster.y

3- Draw copies of monster across the x-axis
Use a while loop
Create a variable for the loop to use, and set it equal to monster.x
Do not change the value of monster.x inside the loop
You can space the monsters out evenly using monster.spacing as the increment you increase the variable by
monster and all the copies of monster should be moving diagonally together

4- Draw a tile floor (stop the monsters from leaving a dirt trail)
Use a nested for loop to draw squares across the whole screen
Use tileSize
Make sure the monsters are on top of the tiles

Bonus Challenge
Make either your monsters or your tiles have different colors in different places on screen.
The color should not flash rapidly. The goal is for each copy/tile to stay the same color, while being different from the ones around it.
