1- Add your name
add your name, so that it says "YOURNAME's..."

in sketch.js
2- Finish the code so the bouncing ball bounces correctly
ball should move right until it reaches the edge of the canvas, then change direction and move right until it reaches the edge of the canvas, then change direction again, etc
Try to use only a single if statement, using && and/or || as needed

3- Change ball.color to match the background as it moves (critter camouflage!)
ball.color should be color1 while crossing the first third of the background, color2 in the middle, and color3 in the last third

4- Create a boolean variable called movingTowardsMouse, and assign the right value using an if statement
movingTowardsMouse should be set to true when:
beast is moving to the right and the mouse is to the right of the beast
OR beast is moving to the left and the mouse is to the left of the beast
otherwise it should be set to false

5- Use an if statement to update beast.message to say whether it is chasing or fleeing the mouse
If movingTowardsMouse is true, the message should say "Chasing mouse"
If movingTowardsMouse is false, the message should say "Fleeing mouse"

Bonus Challenge
Make your beast move and bounce in both the x and y directions.
Ensure that beast still bounces the entire width of the canvas.
The movingTowardMouse boolean should still only care about the x-axis values.
