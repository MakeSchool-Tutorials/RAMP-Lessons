1- Add your name
add your name, so that it says "YOURNAME's..."

in sketch.js
2- Create a growOrReset function
This function should call plantGrow if the mouse is on the right side of the screen
This function should call plantReset if the mouse is on the left side of the screen
Uncomment growOrReset(); inside of draw and check in the console to see if plant.size is changing correctly

3- Create a drawPlant function
If plant.size is 0, call drawSeed, otherwise call drawSprout and drawBloom
Uncomment the two lines with drawPlant(...); inside of draw and watch the two plants grow and bloom

4- Create a plantLabel function
return a string saying whether the plant is a "seed", "growing", or "blooming" based on it's current properties
Uncomment text(plantLabel(), 10, 20); inside of draw and you should now see a label in the upper left corner

Bonus Challenge
Display a field of plants instead of just one plant. Can you get them to grow and bloom at different speeds?

This is an advanced challenge. You will need to update almost every single function.
